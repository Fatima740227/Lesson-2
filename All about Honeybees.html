<h2 style="-webkit-text-fill-color: yellow;">The buzz about Honeybees</h2>
<p style="-webkit-text-fill-color:white;">Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their roles in pollination and, in the case of the
best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are currently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are over 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. Some species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies while most species including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees are solitary.

Bees are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimeters (0.08 in) long,] to the leafcutter bee Megachile pluto, the largest species of bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimeters (1.54 in).</p>

<h2 style="-webkit-text-fill-color:gold">Why honeybees are important?</h2>
<h3 style="-webkit-text-fill-color:yellow;">Importance of honeybees</h3>
<p style="-webkit-text-fill-color:white;">The simplest answer is that bees pollinate food crops. Pollination occurs when insects like bees and other pollinators travel from one plant to the next fertilizing the plant. Bees have little hairs all over their body that attract pollen.
Honeybees pollinate $15 billion worth of crops in the United States each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in 2017.</p>
